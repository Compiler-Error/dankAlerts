dankAlerts is powered by Sysmon and Memes.  Would you really notice if a suspicious process was recorded in the event log of your small or medium size network? Not likely. dankAlerts presents anomalies to you in text written into meme images and guides you in order to reduce false positives.  Alerts from other systems can be sent to your workstatation via Base64encoded secure get requests to a python HTTPS enabled SimpleHTTPServer module. This method is used to strickly limit write access between systems.
